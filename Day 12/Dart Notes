First-class objects

In programming, the term first-class objects (also known as first-class citizens) refers to entities that can be treated uniformly in a language. When something is a first-class object, it means that it can:

    Be assigned to a variable: You can store it in a variable.
    Be passed as an argument to a function: You can pass it into a function like any other data type.
    Be returned from a function: You can return it from a function.
    Be created at runtime: You can dynamically create it during execution.
    Be stored in data structures: It can be used inside lists, maps, sets, etc.



Closure Function : 
Even a "normal" function stored in a variable is a closure if it captures variables from its enclosing scope



Functions name based on parameter :

0 parameter --> nullary Function
1 parameter --> uniary Function
2 parameter --> binary Function



Private variables:
        String name --> public
        String _name --> private

private are library scoped (library means a dart file (Eg. func.dart))
